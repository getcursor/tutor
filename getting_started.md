# Getting started

Welcome to Cursor! Here are the basics:

* Highlight code. Hit Cmd+K to prompt an edit.
* Try typing. When you see a suggested diff or autocomplete, hit Tab to accept.
* Open chat by typing Cmd+L.
  - Use @ to import files or documentation
  - Highlight code and hit Cmd+Shift+L to focus the AI on particular pieces of code
  - Try the "with codebase" button to ask about the entire repo

Try using Cursor to generate edits, spot bugs, find code, learn about docs, and explain code. If you're looking for more long tail features, try hovering hover a lint and hitting "Fix in Chat," using Command-K in terminal to generate terminal commands, pasting an image into Chat or Command-K to give the AI context, or clicking on "Auto-Debug" after hitting a terminal errors.

If you run into any trouble or have any feedback, feel free to post on forum.cursor.sh.
